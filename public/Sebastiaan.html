            vision on what we wanted to do, and this lecture showed us how to organize and structurize our plan. </td>

            overall well structurized and allowed us to conclude that we had everything set up properly</td>

            <td>The pitches given by employees of the Rijksmuseum were very useful, as they only made us feel more secure about our idea.
            Some subjects were more interesting than others which sometimes caused me to loose my focus, but in the end I learned what i thought I would.
            The tour through the museum was exremely insightful and above all fun. Walking thorugh the museum with a guide who no only gave us the best route,
            but who was also a walking encyclopedia, regarding the artpieces, made the tour really enjoyable. This made me think even more about
            possible routes through the museum.</td>

            <td>The parts about UX degsin were especially interesting, since it showed me how much it affects how users use your website.
            During the time before the lecture we had already drawn a sketch of our website, and at the end of the lecture we had to do this
            again. The feedback from other students as well as our professor was really helpful as it was the foundation of our site's current look.</td>

            <td>We scored a 3/4 so we were very content with how it went. It was kind of difficult to put everything we wanted to do and
            accomplish in a short 2-minute pitch, but in the end it worked out quite well. It was also nice to know that no other group
            had a really similar idea, which made our project more unique than anticipated. </td>
