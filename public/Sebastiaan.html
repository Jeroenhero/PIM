                I learned a lot of interseting things I never thought I would. Such as the p;rocess of restaurating a painting, or how complicated a ticket system can be.
            The tour through the museum was exremely insightful and above all fun. Walking thorugh the museum with a guide who no only gave us the best route,
            but who was also a walking encyclopedia, regarding the artpieces, made the tour really enjoyable. This made me think even more about

        <tr><td>I believe it's safe to say that I had an active, participating role in this project. From the creation of the idea, up to the
        demo presentation of our website I have always contributed my part to the project. Jeroen and Stan did a great job themselves as well, this project couldn't have
        been what is is today without either one of us three. We divided the tasks evenly, whether it was coding in html, css, and javascript, or designing logo's, communicating
        with employees from the Rijksmuseum, and more. I personally mainly designed the website itself, and coded the route generator page. But we all helped each other
            with each other's tasks at some point. <br><br>

            This course has given me a first taste of what I might do after my study. It combined many aspects from previous courses
        into one project in which we were free to do almost everything the way we wanted to. I think it was a really good move to make this course about the rijksmuseum, it gave us
        the opportunity to put our knowledge to the test and try to use everything we've learned this past year, to create something that might actually have an effect on many people.
            Above that, my website building skills have definitely improved in ways not foreseen! I really got the hang of Bootstrap, and with help from Jeroen I was able to
            learn a lot about both javascript and Dom, which is really useful.
            <br><br>

            I've gained quite some additional insights, whether it's how to pitch an idea in an insanely short amount of time, or how complicated some simple looking information
        systems actually are. Above all I gained the insight to use many different types of knowledge to create an end product like <a href="https://rijksroute.nl"  target="_blank">RijksRoute</a>. </td></tr>
