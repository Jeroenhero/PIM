    <h1 class="text-center">Introduction</h1>
    <p class="inside-text">Hi! I'm Jeroen, a 19 year old IMM Student! During the past month, I have worked together with 2 other students (<a
            href="Sebastiaan.html">Sebastiaan</a> & <a href="Stan.html">Stan</a>) on creating an awesome webapplication for the Rijksmuseum;
        <a href="https://rijksroute.nl">Rijksroute.nl!</a> This web application allows people to generate their own custom routes through the museum,
    encouraging young people to visit the museum and discover new art based on their preferences. We have put a lot of time into creating this website,
    and making sure that everything works like we we expect it to work, and I am pleased to say that I'm really happy with the final result.
    For this project, I have mainly focussed on the technical aspects, for example the algorithm for creating the routes in the museum,
    for this I used my previous experience with programming, as well as some creativity to simplify problems.

    I have really enjoyed working on this project, as it allowed me to use knowledge gathered in and outside university together to create a
    real-life application. This practical setup is really useful because you get a task which you are assigned to and you will have to implement
    a solution for that and later on receive feedback based on it. I would'nt mind having more similar courses!
    While making the project, the idea started feeling better and better, causing me to really put some dedication into finishing it, trying to get the
    perfect end result. In the days before the final demonstration, I would often work on it until late in order to complete a "perfect" website,
    where even really small issues, such as how a cursor looks like while hovering over text, where tackled.</p>

            Due to my previous experience with websites and programming, using tools like Github, Trello or the Webstorm IDE was really easy.
            Setting up Firebase was a bit of a challenge due to compatibility issues but eventually turned out really well.</td>

            interesting and effective than I expected. We got a lot of inspiration from the talks, the tour and the tourguide
                With the insipration gathered at the museum we fully developed the plan for our idea and discussed this with the Rijksmuseum experts.
            We were so motivated to implement our idea that we immediately (While in the museum) purchased our domain name, rijksroute.nl</td>

            part where we got 3 different drawings of computers where it allowed to us to make a design for the website. This was really helpful
            for expressing the different ideas we had. </td>

            in such a way that people would truly experience art in a unique and rememberable way. It showed us some points which can be important for
            our own website, for example that it is important that you don't make the system too interactive and still maintain focus on the
            actual art.
            Tips for the pitches were also useful, for example what terms you should avoid using during the pitches and that you should keep it simple.
            Keeping it simple is an issue for me, whereas I'm often making things too complicated.</td>

            porter's value chain. In general, I considered this lecture to be a bit unrelated to the rest of the course. Some parts matched, for example
            the part about the aims and goals of the application you are creating, but it also contained some irrelevant parts which weren't that interesting
            in my opinion.</td>

            lectures at the Rijksmuseum visit. Furthermore, there were a couple topics inside the lecture which were interesting and useful,
            for example the part regarding image sizes which could range up to 80GB.</td>
