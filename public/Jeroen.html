            looking through canvas to prepare for this course.</td>

            <td>I believed this lecture had no additional value for me, we already setup everything before the lecture started.
            Due to my previous experience with websites and programming, using tools like Github, Trello or the Webstorm IDE was really easy.
            Setting up Firebase was a bit of a challenge due to compatibility issues but eventually turned out really well.</td>

            <td>Really useful and interesting visit, especially because I have never been in the Rijksmuseum before. It turned out to be way more
            interesting and effective than I expected. We got a lot of inspiration from the talks, the tour and the tourguide
                With the insipration gathered at the museum we fully developed the plan for our idea and discussed this with the Rijksmuseum experts.
            We were so motivated to implement our idea that we immediately (While in the museum) purchased our domain name, rijksroute.nl</td>

            <td>3: UX Design + Rijksmuseum review</td>
            <td>The UX part was really interesting, this is something I've not worked with before. I liked the explanation as well as the "Practical"
            part where we got 3 different drawings of computers where it allowed to us to make a design for the website. This was really helpful
            for expressing the different ideas we had. </td>
